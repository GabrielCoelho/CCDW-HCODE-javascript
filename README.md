# Update in 2023

As I'm getting back at my degree in System Development, I've returned to commit some changes to remember some basic stuffs and researching some others that I wasn't using. 

[[2023-07-20]] - I'm using the `modelo2.html` and the `js/script.js` to code some examples and exercises of a book that I'm reading and guiding myself. 
All other folders and files will remain the same as it was. My classes begin in two weeks. More repositories will come. 

> Fells good to be back.
